# JavaScript Password Generator

The JavaScript password generator can be used to create unique passwords based on the criteria selected.
You can choose to include symbols, numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, or any combination thereof, as well as how many characters in length the password should be, giving you near infinite possibilities!

## Project Requirements
**User Story**  
> AS AN employee with access to sensitive data  
> I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria  
> SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

**Acceptance Criteria**
> GIVEN I need a new, secure password:  
> WHEN I click the button to generate a password, I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.  
> WHEN prompted for password criteria, I select which criteria to include in the password.  
> WHEN prompted for the length of the password, I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.  
> WHEN asked for character types to include in the password, I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  
> WHEN I answer each prompt, my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.  
> WHEN all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.  
> WHEN the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
